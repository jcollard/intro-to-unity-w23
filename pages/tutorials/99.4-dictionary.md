# Using the Dictionary Class in C#
{: .no_toc }

The Dictionary class in C# is a powerful and versatile collection type which allows you to store and access data using a key-value pair. It is a generic collection that allows you to store any type of data as the key and any type of data as the value. In this tutorial, we will explore why and how to use the Dictionary class and look at an example of using it to count the occurrences of each letter in a string.

## Introduction to the Dictionary Class

The Dictionary class provides an efficient way to represent and store key-value pairs. A key is used to reference a value, and the key-value pair is stored in a collection. Any type of data can be stored as a key or value in a Dictionary.

The Dictionary class is implemented as a hash table, which makes it very efficient for retrieving values by key. The Dictionary class also provides methods for adding, removing, and modifying key-value pairs, as well as searching and looping through the collection. 

## Example: Using a Dictionary to Count Letters in a String

In this example, we will use the Dictionary class to count the occurrences of each letter in a string. We will declare a Dictionary with a `char` key and an `int` value. We will then loop through a string and count the occurrences of each letter, storing them in the dictionary. Lastly, we will loop through the keys and values of the dictionary and print the total counts of each character.

```csharp
// Declare a Dictionary with a char key and an int value
Dictionary<char, int> letterCounts = new Dictionary<char, int>();

// Create a string to count the occurrences of each letter in
string myString = "This is a test string";

// Loop through the string and count the occurrences of each letter
foreach (char c in myString)
{
    // If the letter is already in the dictionary, increment its count
    if (letterCounts.ContainsKey(c))
    {
        letterCounts[c]++;
    }
    // Otherwise, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1
    else
    {
        letterCounts.Add(c, 1);
    }
}

// Loop through the dictionary and print the total counts of each character
foreach (KeyValuePair<char, int> pair in letterCounts)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{pair.Key} : {pair.Value}");
}
```

The output of the above code will be:

```
 : 4
a : 2
e : 1
g : 1
h : 1
i : 3
n : 1
r : 1
s : 3
t : 4
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored why and how to use the Dictionary class in C#. We looked at an example of using the Dictionary class to count the occurrences of each letter in a string. We declared a Dictionary with a `char` key and an `int` value, looped through a string and counted the occurrences of each letter, stored them in the dictionary, and then looped through the keys and values of the dictionary and printed the total counts of each character.
