# Introduction to C# Lists

C# Lists are a powerful tool for organizing data. Lists provide many advantages over standard arrays, such as being able to add and remove elements without having to re-declare the list size. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of C# Lists and how to use them in your programs. We'll also discuss the differences between using Lists and Arrays.

## Declaring a List

Before you can use a List, you'll need to declare it. You can declare a List using the `List<T>` syntax. The `T` specifies the data type of the List. For example, if you want to declare a List of integers, you would use the following syntax:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
```

You can also use this syntax to declare a List with a string data type:

```c#
List<string> myList = new List<string>();
```

## Initializing a List

Once you have declared a List, you can initialize it with data. There are several ways to do this. 

### Using the Add Method

The first way is to use the `Add` method. This method takes an argument of the data type specified in the List declaration. So, if you declared a List of integers, you will pass an integer as an argument. 

For example, here is how you would initialize a List of integers using the `Add` method:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);
```

Here is how you would initialize a List of strings using the `Add` method:

```c#
List<string> myList = new List<string>();
myList.Add("one");
myList.Add("two");
myList.Add("three");
```

### Using the AddRange Method

The second way to initialize a List is to use the `AddRange` method. The `AddRange` method takes an array of the data type specified in the List declaration. So, if you declared a List of integers, you will pass an array of integers as an argument. 

For example, here is how you would initialize a List of integers using the `AddRange` method:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
int[] intArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3};
myList.AddRange(intArray);
```

Here is how you would initialize a List of strings using the `AddRange` method:

```c#
List<string> myList = new List<string>();
string[] stringArray = new string[] {"one", "two", "three"};
myList.AddRange(stringArray);
```

### Using the Constructor

The third way to initialize a List is to use the constructor. The constructor takes an array of the data type specified in the List declaration. So, if you declared a List of integers, you will pass an array of integers as an argument. 

For example, here is how you would initialize a List of integers using the constructor:

```c#
int[] intArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3};
List<int> myList = new List<int>(intArray);
```

Here is how you would initialize a List of strings using the constructor:

```c#
string[] stringArray = new string[] {"one", "two", "three"};
List<string> myList = new List<string>(stringArray);
```

## Checking the Length of a List

You can check the length of a List by using the `Count` property. This will return the number of elements in the List. 

For example:

```c#
List<string> myList = new List<string>();
myList.Add("one");
myList.Add("two");
myList.Add("three");

// Print out the length of the List
Console.WriteLine(myList.Count); // Outputs 3
```

## Accessing and Setting Values in a List

You can access an element in a List by using the index of the element. The index of the first element is 0, the index of the second element is 1, and so on.

You can also set the value of an element in a List. To do this, you must first access the element using its index and then assign a new value to it. 

For example: 

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Access the first element in the List
int firstElement = myList[0]; // Outputs 1

// Set the first element in the List
myList[0] = 4;

// Print out the first element in the List
Console.WriteLine(myList[0]); // Outputs 4
```

## Adding Elements to a List

You can add elements to a List using the `Add` method. This method takes an argument of the data type specified in the List declaration. So, if you declared a List of integers, you will pass an integer as an argument. 

For example:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Add a new element to the List
myList.Add(4);

// Print out the List
foreach (int element in myList) {
 Console.WriteLine(element); // Outputs 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

## Removing Elements from a List

You can remove elements from a List using the `Remove` method. This method takes an argument of the data type specified in the List declaration. So, if you declared a List of integers, you will pass an integer as an argument. 

For example:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Remove the second element from the List
myList.Remove(2);

// Print out the List
foreach (int element in myList) {
 Console.WriteLine(element); // Outputs 1, 3
}
```

## Inserting Elements into a List

You can insert elements into a List using the `Insert` method. This method takes two arguments: the index of the element you wish to insert before, and the element you wish to insert. 

For example:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Insert the number 4 before the third element
myList.Insert(2, 4);

// Print out the List
foreach (int element in myList) {
 Console.WriteLine(element); // Outputs 1, 2, 4, 3
}
```

## Removing Elements from a List at a Given Index

You can remove elements from a List at a given index using the `RemoveAt` method. This method takes an argument of the index of the element you wish to remove. 

For example:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Remove the second element from the List
myList.RemoveAt(1);

// Print out the List
foreach (int element in myList) {
 Console.WriteLine(element); // Outputs 1, 3
}
```

## Searching for Elements in a List using Contains

You can search for elements in a List using the `Contains` method. This method takes an argument of the element you wish to search for. It will return `true` if the element is found in the List, or `false` if it is not.

For example:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Check if the List contains the number 2
bool containsTwo = myList.Contains(2); // Outputs true
```

## Finding the Index of an Element in a List using IndexOf

You can find the index of an element in a List using the `IndexOf` method. This method takes an argument of the element you wish to search for. It will return the index of the element if it is found in the List, or `-1` if it is not.

For example:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Check the index of the number 2
int indexOfTwo = myList.IndexOf(2); // Outputs 1
```

## Looping Over a List using a Traditional For Loop

You can loop over a List using a traditional for loop. This method takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index. 

For example:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Loop over the List
for (int i = 0; i < myList.Count; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine(myList[i]); // Outputs 1, 2, 3
}
```

## Looping Over a List using a Foreach Loop

You can also loop over a List using a foreach loop. This method takes an argument of the data type specified in the List declaration. 

For example:

```c#
List<int> myList = new List<int>();
myList.Add(1);
myList.Add(2);
myList.Add(3);

// Loop over the List
foreach (int element in myList) {
  Console.WriteLine(element); // Outputs 1, 2, 3
}
```

## Example

Let's look at a complete example of how to use C# Lists. In this example, we will declare a List of strings which are members of the Avengers as well as Batman and Superman. We will then remove Batman using an index, remove Superman using the string "Superman", display the size of the list, and loop over the list to display the names that are left in the list.

```c#
List<string> avengers = new List<string> { "Iron Man", "Captain America", "Thor", "Hulk", "Black Widow", "Hawkeye", "Batman", "Superman" };

// Remove Batman using an index
avengers.RemoveAt(6);

// Remove Superman using the string "Superman"
avengers.Remove("Superman");

// Display the size of the list
Console.WriteLine(avengers.Count); // Outputs 6

// Loop over the list and display the names that are left in the list
foreach (string name in avengers)
{
  Console.WriteLine(name); // Outputs Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye
}
```
