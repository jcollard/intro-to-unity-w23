# Creating a Class in C#
{: .no_toc }

Creating a class in C# is an important part of Object Oriented Programming. A class is a blueprint for creating objects that have properties and methods. In this tutorial, we will create a class called Player and learn how to declare properties, encapsulate properties, declare a constructor, construct a class, customize property methods, declare methods, and declare static methods.

## What is a class?
A class is a blueprint for creating an object. It is used to define the structure of an object and its properties and methods. A class has two main parts: properties and methods. Properties are variables that can be used to store data and methods are functions that can be used to perform actions.

## Declaring a class named Player
To declare a class, use the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class. In this case, we will declare a class named `Player`.

```csharp
public class Player
{

}
```

## Declaring properties for the Player class
Properties are variables that can be used to store data. To declare properties in the Player class, we will use auto properties. Auto properties are properties that are declared on one line and have a public get and set. In this example, we will declare three public properties: a `string` named Name, an `int` named HP, and an `int` named MaxHP.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int HP { get; set; }
    public int MaxHP { get; set; }
}
```

## Encapsulating properties using private set
Encapsulation is an important concept in object oriented programming. It allows us to control how our objects interact with each other by limiting access to certain properties and methods. To encapsulate the Name and MaxHP properties, we will change the auto property to have a private set. This will allow us to control how the Name and MaxHP properties are set while still allowing us to get their values.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int HP { get; set; }
    public int MaxHP { get; private set; }
}
```

## Declaring a constructor
A constructor is a special method that is used to create an instance of a class. To declare a constructor for the Player class, we will use the keyword `public` followed by the name of the class. In this example, we will declare a constructor which accepts a `string` name and an `int` maxhp. The constructor will initialize the Name, HP, and MaxHP properties to the values passed in.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int HP { get; set; }
    public int MaxHP { get; private set; }

    public Player(string name, int maxhp)
    {
        Name = name;
        HP = maxhp;
        MaxHP = maxhp;
    }
}
```

## Constructing a class
Now that we have declared our Player class and its constructor, we can use the `new` keyword to construct an instance of the class. In this example, we will construct a Player named "Bob the Builder" with 17 max hp. We will then decrement the HP property by 5 and display the player's name, current hp, and max hp.

```csharp
Player bob = new Player("Bob the Builder", 17);
bob.HP -= 5;
Console.WriteLine($"{bob.Name} has {bob.HP} HP out of {bob.MaxHP}.");
// Output: Bob the Builder has 12 HP out of 17.
```

## Customizing Property methods
We can customize the get and set methods of our properties to control how the data is accessed and modified. In this example, we will update the HP property to use a backing private field `_hp` and the get and set methods will clamp the value between 0 and MaxHP. We will show an example where the HP value remains clamped even when increased or decreased by 100.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    private int _hp;

    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int HP 
    { 
        get { return _hp; } 
        set { _hp = Math.Max(0, Math.Min(value, MaxHP)); }
    }
    public int MaxHP { get; private set; }

    public Player(string name, int maxhp)
    {
        Name = name;
        HP = maxhp;
        MaxHP = maxhp;
    }
}

Player bob = new Player("Bob the Builder", 17);
bob.HP += 100;
Console.WriteLine($"{bob.Name} has {bob.HP} HP out of {bob.MaxHP}.");
bob.HP -= 100;
Console.WriteLine($"{bob.Name} has {bob.HP} HP out of {bob.MaxHP}.");
// Output:
// Bob the Builder has 17 HP out of 17.
// Bob the Builder has 0 HP out of 17.
```

## Methods
Methods are functions that can be used to perform actions. In this example, we will declare a method `LevelUp()` which will double the Player's MaxHP and set the Player's HP to the new MaxHP. We will then show an example displaying a Player's HP and MaxHP, calling LevelUp(), and then displaying the Player's HP and MaxHP again.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    private int _hp;

    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int HP 
    { 
        get { return _hp; } 
        set { _hp = Math.Max(0, Math.Min(value, MaxHP)); }
    }
    public int MaxHP { get; private set; }

    public Player(string name, int maxhp)
    {
        Name = name;
        HP = maxhp;
        MaxHP = maxhp;
    }

    public void LevelUp()
    {
        MaxHP *= 2;
        HP = MaxHP;
    }
}

Player bob = new Player("Bob the Builder", 17);
Console.WriteLine($"{bob.Name} has {bob.HP} HP out of {bob.MaxHP}.");
bob.LevelUp();
Console.WriteLine($"{bob.Name} has {bob.HP} HP out of {bob.MaxHP}.");
// Output:
// Bob the Builder has 17 HP out of 17.
// Bob the Builder has 34 HP out of 34.
```

## Static methods
Static methods are methods that can be called without creating an instance of the class. To declare a static method, we will use the `static` keyword. In this example, we will declare a static method `TotalHP(List<Player> players)` which uses a foreach loop to sum the HP of each Player in the list. We will then show an example calling TotalHP on 3 instances of Player and displaying the resulting HP.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    private int _hp;

    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int HP 
    { 
        get { return _hp; } 
        set { _hp = Math.Max(0, Math.Min(value, MaxHP)); }
    }
    public int MaxHP { get; private set; }

    public Player(string name, int maxhp)
    {
        Name = name;
        HP = maxhp;
        MaxHP = maxhp;
    }

    public void LevelUp()
    {
        MaxHP *= 2;
        HP = MaxHP;
    }

    public static int TotalHP(List<Player> players)
    {
        int totalHP = 0;
        foreach (Player player in players)
        {
            totalHP += player.HP;
        }
        return totalHP;
    }
}

Player bob = new Player("Bob the Builder", 17);
Player bill = new Player("Bill the Builder", 25);
Player brian = new Player("Brian the Builder", 8);

List<Player> players = new List<Player> { bob, bill, brian };
int totalHP = Player.TotalHP(players);
Console.WriteLine($"The total HP of the players is {totalHP}.");
// Output: The total HP of the players is 50.
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to create a class in C#. We declared a class named Player, declared properties, encapsulated properties using private set, declared a constructor, constructed a class, customized property methods, declared methods, and declared static methods. By following the steps in this tutorial, you should now have a better understanding of how to create a class in C#.
