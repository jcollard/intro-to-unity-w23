# Verify Personal License

To use Unity, you are required to have a license. Lucky for you, there is a free
to use **Personal License** that gives you the ability to create and publish
games so long as you do not earn more than $100,000 from products you make with
Unity. If you already have a **Personal License**, you can skip this section.

{: .note }
If for whatever reason you happen to earn more than that, these
instructions will not help you.

1. In Unity Hub, click your avatar icon
2. Select `Manage Licenses`

![Manage License](../../imgs/0.1-unity-personal-license/09-manage-license.png)

Verify that you have a personal license. Click the `Licenses` option on the
left. You should see a personal license. If you do not, there are instructions
after the image below.

# Install Unity 2021.3.16f

Throughout this class, we will use the current **Long Term Support** version of
Unity (2021.3.16f1). This version of Unity is considered to be the current
**STABLE** release. 

{: .note }
It is fine to have multiple different versions of Unity installed. However, 
each one has different features. For all of the projects in this class, you
should use `2021.3.16f1`

1. If you have not done so, open **Unity Hub**
2. Click the `Installs` tab from the left menu
3. Click `Install Editor` in the top right

![Install Unity](../../imgs/0.1-unity-personal-license/13-install-unity-2021.png)

4. Verify the version you are installing says `2021.3.16f1`
    * If it is not `2021.3.16f1`, you should search for it in the `Archive` tab.
5. Click `Install`

![Final Install](../../imgs/0.1-unity-personal-license/13-install-correct-version.png)

6. Unselect `Visual Studio Community` (we will use VS Code in this course)

![Do not install VS](../../imgs/0.1-unity-personal-license/14-do-not-install-vs.png)

7. Select `WebGL Build Support` (We will be publishing your projects to the web!)
8. Select `Documentation` (This is super helpful to have when editing code)
9. Click `Install`

![Click Install](../../imgs/0.1-unity-personal-license/15-options-install.png)

{: .note } 
The download is quite large and may take some time to download. While this is
occurring, you should continue to install the rest of the class software.
